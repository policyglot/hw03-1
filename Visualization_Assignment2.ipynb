    "### Data and Objectives\n",
    "The key overarching hypothesis to my research is that individuals present themselves differently across different situations and platforms depending on what they perceive to be desirable in that setting and their strategic goals from the social interaction. In the context of online dating, I am exploring whether men aim to increase their chances of finding a romantic partner specifically by ‘overcoming’ their perceived limitations in physical dimensions (such as height, weight and race) as well as education. \n",
    "If this trend were to be true for any of these variables, we would find a difference in the sub-categories thereof across the self-representations on these men’s profiles. Given the limitations of the available data (see ‘Initial Results’ PDF for more details), we focus on the ‘About Me’ self-introduction and apply topic modelling to assess for strategic choices of language and branding for self-representation.\n",
    "In this particular visualization, our variable of choice is that of education. I have used the completion of a high school diploma as a cut off point for ‘low’ or ‘high’ education. This is based on earning prospects observed above and below the threshold by the US Bureau of Labour Statistics (Torpey, 2018). Subsequent research can build more categories separately for undergraduate and post-graduate studies.\n",

    "### Graphical Form\n",
    "We have three variables at play- \n",
    "#### Qualitative/ Categorical:\n",
    "•\tThe topics derived from the model (and labelled by the human user)\n",
    "•\tThe sub-categories of the variable of interest. Here, we have ‘High School or Less’ versus ‘More than High Score’) \n",
    "#### Quantitative:\n",
    "•\tThe proportion of users whose self-introductions include the given topic. \n",
    "Given these characteristics, some natural candidates for the form of the visualization would include grouped bar charts. However, with 25 topics, this would lead to 50 separate bars (one pair for each of the topics), which would render the graph cramped and unreadable. \n",
    "Instead, we could use some kind of stacking of the two categories on top of each other, so as to conserve space and maintain the aesthetic of the visualization. The challenge is that this could potentially affect the functionality and truthfulness of the graph. The result would resemble a stacked bar chart- giving the false impression that we are dividing one topic among the two categories. The intension is to highlight differences in the proportions, which may be lost with that particular format. \n",

    "### Color\n",
    "As such, any colours could have been used. I chose cyan and purple as they add to the aesthetic appeal of the visualization, without confusing the meaning. \n",
    "It may have been possible to use different colours for the entire lollipop on each category. However, this would have created clutter. So I only applied the colour change at the ‘head’ of each lollipop. The ‘stick’ line was kept a light shade, so as to keep the overall structure clear, but not district from the more important encoding of colour. "

    "### Scale\n",
    "We are now seeking to assess differences in qualitative proportions. Since there are 25 different topics, the percentage of users for any one topic is low. In the data, this never exceeds 18%. Thus, if we were to use the whole range of percentage values, the results would be squashed into the bottom corner. Therefore, we focus only on the first 0 to 20% range so that the finer differences can be more easily discerned. This does not affect the truthfulness of the visualization (our goal was never to highlight the dominance of one topic over another). At the same time, it maintains the insight, aesthetics and functionality. "

    "### Story and Communications\n",
    "The key story- and intriguing insight is that for the most part, the topics that both educated and less educated use in their self-descriptions roughly similar. \n",
    "There do exist some notable differences. More users with limited education emphasize aspects of fun, living in the moment and casualness (relative to those with more than a High School Diploma). But surprisingly, the latter show a markedly higher use of the ‘enthusiasm’ and ‘meet and greet’ topics- suggesting more excitement and interest in meeting new people without representing themselves as exciting company.  \n",
    "Arranging the topics in this order, using clear colour distinctions and a lollilop chart all aim to emphasize these distinctions without a sense of visual overload. \n"
