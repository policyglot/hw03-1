    Parameters
    ----------
    counts : np.ndarray
        2d frequency counts with
        dimensions (`n_classes`, `n_features`)
    feature_names : list
        the token names with length `n_features`
    symmetric_alpha : int
        constant
    use_variance : bool, default True

    -------
    log_odds : pd.DataFrame
        with feature names (one for each of the `n_features`)

    Notes
    -----    
    Is this equation 16 in Monroe et al.?
    
    If so, it looks like the `F` should be multiplied by
    `symmetric_alpha` in the denominator in `odds1`
